I was responsible of the style. I went on the website w3schools to find the codes
for fonts, colors, background color etc. I used internal CSS.

I had this at the beginning for fonts:
.p1 {
font-family: "Copperplate"
}

.p2 {
font-family: "Courier New";
    font-weight: bold;

for background

body {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

 for the title
h1 {
  color: darkgreen;
  margin-left: 250px;

and then we changed margin-left: 250px to center.


and then this to have the texts with the desired font.

</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 p class ="p1">The Brassicas</h1>
<p class="p2">Meet Broccoli, Caluiflower, and Cabbage.</p>
<p class="p2">We are an electronic hyper rock band.</p>


</body>
</html

I sent this to Tim and we added it to the code he had. I wrote cabbage's bio and sent it to Tim.

Tim was putting everything together, we had to edit some of the codes to center the images, texts, etc.
Ryan was responsible of asset creation. He gave us the audios and the visual.
