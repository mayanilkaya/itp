1. I created two sprites
2. for butterfly: said when space key pressed say hello for two seconds
3. for elephant: if key up arrow pressed then go to Butterfly 1.
4. it's not going to butterfly 1.
5. changed it to when flag is clicked and it worked.
6. i added set my variable to 2, switch costume to elephant b- i don't know what the variable actually does.
7. started a new thread: when this sprite clicked.
8. repeat 10-play sound pop until done.
