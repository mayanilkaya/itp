I started like this

var i = prompt("Give me a number.")
undefined
let text = "#"
undefined
let result = text.repeat(i)
undefined
var i = prompt("Give me a number.");
undefined
let text = "#";
undefined
let result = text.repeat(i);
undefined

not working

i want to be able to get the external input and console. log working first.

so i just start with var i=prompt("give me a number.");
console.log (i)

and it prints out the number.
Now I want to print # i times.

going to start with a loop this time and forget what I did.

our binding is size (=8?) so I should start with the variable size.

size = 8

Going back to previous assignments, I totally forgot about the whole xy grid thing.

So if size is 8, height = y = 8 and width = x = 8.
I want it to print # # # # 8 times basically. But it will keep adding one ' ', and subtracting one ' '.



y=0 because that's where it's starting, y < size; y++ because this basically add 1 to y until it's no longer bigger
than size (8) same goes for x.

  let size = 8;
    let chessboard= ''

  for (let y = 0; y  < size; y++) {
    for (let x = 0; x < size; x++) {

       the first line starts with '', when both x and y=0.

  I was running out of time so I did some research and found this book:

  chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript_small.pdf

There was the solution for it.  Looking at the solution did help me understand:

for the first line x=0 and y=0. modulus 2 of that addition equals 0.
when it equals to 0, it's going to start the line by printing ' '.
if not, it's going to start the line by printing '#', and then print ' '.

The lines where it starts with # is always an odd number, meaning they won't be divisible (is that thw rods???) (%2 won't equal to 0)
And it's the opposite for the lines that start with ' '.

and the last line with \n means create new line.

This is actually so much simpler than I realized. It even took me a while to understand
what the code meant. I need more practice!!!!


      if ((x + y) % 2 == 0) {
        chessboard += " ";
      } else {
        chessboard += "#";
      }
    }
    chessboard += "\n";
  }

  console.log(chessboard);
