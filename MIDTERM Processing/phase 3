## Phase 3

I started by making the canvas size 400 x 400 pixels.
I added the fill function to make the shape black.
I deleted the nostroke function because I realized it made the line go away, which
was a part of my original shape.

I took the  instructions on github as reference and got two shapes with this
def drawObject(x,y,s):
    push()
    translate(x, y)
    scale(s)
    fill(0)
    line(50, 0, 50, 100)
    rect(25, 51, 50, 55)
    triangle(25, 50, 50, 10, 74, 50)
    pop()

def draw():
    drawObject(0,0,1)
    drawObject(0,200,1)
