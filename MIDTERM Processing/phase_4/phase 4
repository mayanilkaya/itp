# Midterm Documentation

## Phase 4

it took me a while to understand what I had to do.

I'm dividing the canvas to a 20-by-20 grid, so the scale parameter
should be 20.

the hint on github gives me the clue on how to star.

if the first loop goes thriugh the x-axis and the second one goes through the y-axis, and if
s is 20, that means the code is going to make 20 shapes on the x axis and 20 on the y for every value we have on the canvas.

i start with this:
def draw():
    for x in range(0, 0, 20):
        drawObject(x, y, 20)


I couldn't take it any further
